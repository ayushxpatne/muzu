Issues:

#1
Not able to group by date or month:
we used list view builder to build list using the ExpenseModel class.
to implement the grouping, we need to use something called GroupView, for which we need the data to be in JSON 
or List, and for our usage, we are converting it ExpenseModel Objects, because i learnt it that way.
To change this it will take a lot of time, as i would have to re implement the logic.
FUTURE Scope : add GroupView

#2
The Regression model is not self learning:
We trained the model on data from feb 2023 to feb 2024. It is not self updating yet.

For this i need to write a dedicated flask app, in a structured form, as of now it is scattered.

#3
The current expenses are not being updated for the AI,
it can only give monthly analysis and predictions as of now. Monthly analysis is being implemented.
we can also add categorical analysis along with it. check if it is in line with the usual spending patterns.

#4
The chatbot is being run locally, in future we will connect it diagloflow. 

#5
For simplicity we have limited this to debit, need to implement credit debit
here we can then add the functionality to give user reminder if he has lent some money or his earning to spend 
ratio

#6
Adding analysis of the Title and notes & auto-categorisation for this dataset we cannot since the data is AI generated.
Analysis can be done using NLTK, this would allow us to automatically classify and categorise the expenses.

TODO:
make the llm model for bot
make the chat screen

so far i figured out how to integrate python and flutter, that is via flask

make a bunch of manual pairs and reflections
connect it with gpt api or anythin else which can paraphrase
